# Validate a release tag follows the project's `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`
# form, with an optional pre-release / build-metadata suffix introduced by
# `-` or `.`. Suffix characters are restricted to the SemVer-compatible
# alphabet `[A-Za-z0-9.+-]`.
#
# Used by `.github/workflows/release.yml` to harden both the
# `workflow_dispatch.inputs.tag` and the pushed-tag code paths. The tag
# value flows through an `env:` block first (so YAML expansion cannot
# inject shell payloads) and is then sanity-checked here as defense in
# depth. See the 2026-05-25 review (SEC-1) for the original finding and
# the GitHub Actions security-hardening guidance on "Untrusted input".
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release-validate-tag.sh <tag>
#
# Exits 0 when the tag matches the format, 1 otherwise (with a one-line
# explanation on stderr).

# `[[ =~ ]]` matches against the entire string (no implicit line-by-line
# loop the way `grep` does), so an injection payload that smuggles a
# newline cannot satisfy `^...$` for a benign-looking first line.
# SemVer-style separators: `-` for pre-release, `+` for build metadata.
# Anything else (a fourth dotted component, a space, a shell metacharacter)
# is refused.
